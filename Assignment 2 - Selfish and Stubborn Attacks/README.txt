Steps for running code:
1) Run $mkdir outputs
2) Run $g++ big.cpp -std=c++11
3) Run $./a.out
4) This will prompt to enter the parameters for simulation, enter those.
5) Output files frac_nodes_in_longest_chain.txt are generated which can be ignored (can use in demo). All tree files are generated in "outputs" folder by the name tree_<node id>.txt. there are other .dot and .png files as well.
